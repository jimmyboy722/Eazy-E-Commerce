## <ins>Why do web dev projects need a good README file? The answer to this question is extensive, so I'll stick to the main ideas...</ins>
- Provides a description of what your program/product is used for along with some insite as to why it was created.
- Evinces the value of your project.
- Makes it easy for other developers to understand and collaborate on, should they chose to.

## <ins>Installation</ins>
In order to create this README generator, I had to download the following:
- Node.js. This is the runtime environment I used in conjunciton with my IDE to code this project. You can download the current version of node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en)

- Once node.js is installed, you have to install the RDBMS PostgreSql

## <ins>Usage</ins>
 - To use this generator, simply run the command `node index.js` in your terminal and the npm inquirer's *prompt* method will (no pun intended) prompt you to answer questions needed to generate your README.
